The favorites screen shows a list of orchids that the user has marked as favorites. Users can add or remove orchids from their favorites list by tapping the heart icon on an orchid card.

## Functionality

### Filter by Category

The Orchids App allows users to filter the displayed orchids by category. Users can choose from various categories such as Phalaenopsis, Cattleya, Dendrobium, and more. When a category is selected, only the orchids belonging to that category will be shown on the home screen.

### Favorite Orchids

Users can mark orchids as favorites by tapping the heart icon on an orchid card. The favorites are stored using AsyncStorage, allowing users to access their favorite orchids even after closing and reopening the app.

## Dependencies

The Orchids App utilizes the following dependencies:

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
- Expo: A set of tools and services for building, deploying, and running React Native apps.
- AsyncStorage: A simple, asynchronous, persistent key-value storage system used for storing the favorite orchids.
- NativeWind: uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.
